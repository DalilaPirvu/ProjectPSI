# ProjectPSI

Part I: Gaussian free field: correlation functions from ensembles of numerical simulations
Part II: vacuum decay from wavepacket collisions

This code was used to produce the numerical data and the figures for my final research project part of the Perimeter Scholars International program and Masters in Physics at University of Waterloo.

The file contains a modified version of the FORTRAN code `1d-scalar' by J. Braden, as it was used in our study.
The code produced the ensembles of simulations of a relativistic massive scalar field evolving in 1+1 dimensions.
For the original version, see <<https://github.com/jonathanbraden/1d-Scalar>>.

The dependencies for this code are the same as for `1d-scalar'.
The data analysis and plotting were done using NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib libraries in Python3.
